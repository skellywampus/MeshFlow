## Overview

This repository contains the official device firmware for Meshtastic, an open-source LoRa mesh networking project designed for long-range, low-power communication without relying on internet or cellular infrastructure. The firmware supports various hardware platforms, including ESP32, nRF52, RP2040/RP2350, and Linux-based devices.

Meshtastic enables text messaging, location sharing, and telemetry over a decentralized mesh network, making it ideal for outdoor adventures, emergency preparedness, and remote operations.

## Local ThinkNode M9 build

The local `thinknode_m9-tft` release uses companion Device UI commit `2c3d755`.
This revision replaces the SD storage pthread mutex with an embedded static FreeRTOS mutex after a captured startup LoadProhibited panic in `FatFsStorage::mount()` / `release()`. The invalid mutex handle is confirmed; startup allocation pressure is a possible trigger, not proven by the capture. Node-action buttons also have six-pixel spacing and a one-pixel focus outline.

Flash only the application at `0x10000` using the established local procedure; preserve the installed partition table, NVS, OTA metadata and filesystems. Physical startup stability and menu appearance require user confirmation after the final flash.

M9 power revision: screen-off CPU scales to 80 MHz while Wi-Fi is off, display refresh is paused, and the sleeping UI yields 20 ms between iterations. Full 240 MHz/fast polling returns on wake. Protocol/model handling and configured GNSS/radio services continue. FTP/WebDAV honor the existing Wi-Fi minimum modem power-save build option. Automatic SoC light sleep remains disabled in this SDK pending radio/keyboard wake validation. See the local release package power report for measurements and limits.
